## Containers and Docker

A overview of docker, images, and containers.

### What is Docker?

Docker is a container runtime that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications.

### What is a Image?

A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. A container gets instantiated from a container image.

### What is a Container?

A container is a standard unit of software where you code and all its dependencies has been packaged up, so the application can run quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Advantages of using Containers:

* Portable
* Lightweight, as containers share the kernel of the OS
* Secure, while containers share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space.

A nice demonstration on the difference between containers and VM's:
